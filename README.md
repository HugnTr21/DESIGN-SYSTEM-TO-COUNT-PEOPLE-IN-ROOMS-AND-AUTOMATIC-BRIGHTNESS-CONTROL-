#DESIGN SYSTEM TO COUNT PEOPLE IN ROOMS AND AUTOMATIC BRIGHTNESS CONTROL 

The system utilizes IR sensors to count the number of people in the room and a light-dependent resistor (LDR) to measure ambient light intensity. Based on the collected data, the PIC16F877A microcontroller automatically adjusts the brightness of the lights, ensuring optimal illumination, energy efficiency.
